# Princess Auto Products Scraper 

This is one of the first web scrapers that I built utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This scrapes all the products off the Princess Auto Website. The output is either txt or csv format. This is not an efficient method to scrape the products and improvements can be made to this. The 'CHROMEDRIVER_PATH' is just the path to my chrome driver. I updated the excel file with pictures in the comments when the product is hovered over.
